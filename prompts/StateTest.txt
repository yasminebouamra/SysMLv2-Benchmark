A SysMLv2 model in a "StateTest" package, showcasing a complex state machine, including nested and parallel states, signal-based transitions, and inheritance. The model illustrates the behavior of a system through states like initial, parallel, and inherited states, including actions and transitions that are triggered by attributes representing signals. It also demonstrates sending signals between parts and specific action behavior upon entering or exiting states.
