**SysML V2 Code:**

```sysml
package FlashlightSystem

type OnOffCommand
type Light

part User
part Flashlight
part ReflectingSurface

port OnOffCommandPort : In(OnOffCommand)
port LightPort : Out(Light)

flow User.OnOffCommandPort -> Flashlight.OnOffCommandPort
flow Flashlight.LightPort -> ReflectingSurface.LightPort

```

**Explanation:**

* **Types:** The `OnOffCommand` and `Light` types represent the user's commands and the emitted light, respectively.
* **Ports:** The `OnOffCommandPort` receives on-off commands from the user, while the `LightPort` transmits light from the flashlight.
* **Parts:** The `User`, `Flashlight`, and `ReflectingSurface` parts represent the interacting entities.
* **Flows:** The flow from the user's command port to the flashlight's command port and from the flashlight's light port to the reflecting surface port simulate the interaction and light emission.

**Note:** This code only includes the necessary elements and connections for the flashlight system. You may need to further expand it based on your specific needs and requirements.
