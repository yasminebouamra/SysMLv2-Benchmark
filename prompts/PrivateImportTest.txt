Explore a SysMLv2 model that demonstrates the use of private and public imports within nested packages. This example encompasses part definitions across multiple packages, showcasing how private imports restrict visibility outside their scope, yet allowing access within the same package. Also, observe how a public import with the 'all' directive can override private import restrictions, enabling access to previously restricted parts.
