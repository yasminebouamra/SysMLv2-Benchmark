Create a SysML v2 model that defines a package named `AnalysisTest` which includes a part with a measurable attribute, a requirement that outlines an analysis objective, and two analysis definitions. One analysis definition should specify how the part's property is used in an objective, and another should outline a plan involving a nested analysis case. Also, include a part that represents the context for running the analysis plan on the specified part instance.
