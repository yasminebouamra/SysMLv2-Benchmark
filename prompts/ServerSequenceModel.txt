Design a simplistic SysMLv2 model to represent a Publish-Subscribe system, focusing on the interactions and sequences of events between a publisher, a subscriber, and a server. With specific attention to the elements such as Subscribe, Publish, and Deliver signals, detail the subscription request, publication event, and delivery of publication content within the system. The model should encapsulate the sequence of actions starting from a subscriber expressing interest in a topic, through a publisher posting content on that topic, to the server facilitating the delivery of content to the subscribed consumer.
