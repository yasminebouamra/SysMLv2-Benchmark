Design a SysMLv2 model within a package called `ItemTest` that demonstrates basic principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, references, and communication. This model should include a main item `A` that contains a part of type `B` and a protected reference to a part `C`. `B` should be abstract with an abstract part of type `A`, creating a circular dependency. `C` is a private part that can reference items of type `A` or `B`. Also, define a port `P` with input and output capabilities for items of type `A`.
