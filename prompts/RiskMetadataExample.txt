A model defined in SysMLv2 within a package named "RiskMetadataExample" illustrates the risk metadata associated with an automotive engine part, specifically a four-cylinder engine. The model incorporates predefined metadata and risk levels from other packages to annotate the engine part with specific risk attributes. These annotations include overall, technical, and schedule risk levels, with additional detailed assessment on the probability and impact of the total risk.
