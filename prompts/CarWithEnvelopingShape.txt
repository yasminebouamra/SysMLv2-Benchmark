Design a SysMLv2 model that specifies a car's physical dimensions using an abstraction of a 'bounding box' to encapsulate the vehicle's external boundaries. The model should incorporate a basic shape, specifically a box, to represent the vehicle's enveloping shape. This entails detailed specification of the car's length, width, and height in millimeters, illustrating the vehicle's size by leveraging a modular approach which reuses a box shape definition from a separate namespace, along with the SI units for measurement.
