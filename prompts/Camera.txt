A model of a Camera system is constructed with specific functionalities for taking pictures, incorporating elements from the PictureTaking namespace. This system is structured with a private import to utilize the PictureTaking capabilities internally. It is designed to perform the action of taking pictures, which is a specialized action derived from the PictureTaking namespace. The Camera system comprises two main subsystems: one for focusing and another for imaging. Each subsystem is responsible for executing a part of the picture-taking process, where the focusing subsystem adjusts focus and the imaging subsystem captures the image as part of the overall takePicture action.
