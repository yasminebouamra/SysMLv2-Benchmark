A SysMLv2 model demonstrating a complex system with the concept of multicausation, where multiple causes lead to multiple effects. This model, contained within the `CauseAndEffectExample` package, utilizes part definitions, connection definitions, and instances to illustrate these relationships. Additionally, it incorporates elements with undefined types to show further interactions and specifies metadata for particular cause-to-effect connections, highlighting properties like necessity and probability.
