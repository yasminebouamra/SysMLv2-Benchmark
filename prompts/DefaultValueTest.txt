A SysML v2 model demonstrating parts, attributes, inheritance, and use of default values. The model includes a part definition with attributes bearing default values and others with fixed values. Instances of this part override defaults, and a derived part definition modifies a default value based on another attribute. The model encapsulates these definitions within a package, showcasing inheritance and attribute manipulation.
