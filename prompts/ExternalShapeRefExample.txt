This model demonstrates referencing an external geometry for a part, specifically a battery unit, and detailing a simple geometric shape for the same part within a SysML v2 system model. It shows how to annotate a part with a reference to its detailed external geometry for high levels of detail, using a shell shape linked to a STEP file, and also how to define a simplified abstract shape, a box, for less detailed scenarios. This approach enables flexibility in modeling by allowing for both detailed external references and simplified internal definitions.
