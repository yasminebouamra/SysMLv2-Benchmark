Design a SysMLv2 model to illustrate the interactions and sequences within the Norwegian scenario of the Arrowhead Framework. The model should encompass a local cloud data distribution setup involving parts like TellUConsumer, APISProducer, MQTTServer, and APISConsumer. Include the sequence of API service transfers, with MQTT protocol facilitating message forwarding. Define parts, event occurrences, message flows, and interfaces to accurately represent the orchestration of interactions for data requests and handling in a distributed system context.
