The model encapsulates a comprehensive system for labeling and categorizing system components based on their security clearance level. It introduces a specialized package equipped with a custom enumeration to distinguish the security classifications (unclassified, confidential, secret) and employs metadata definitions to annotate system components with their respective classifications. This setup not only facilitates a rigorous marking of elements according to their sensitivity but also demonstrates the application of metadata to enforce security protocols effectively, ensuring components are managed in line with their security designations.
