This model in SysMLV2 focuses on defining the geometric structure and relational assembly of a vehicle. It includes detailed specifications for the vehicle's chassis, wheels, and lug bolts, making use of coordinate frames and transformations to specify their shapes, dimensions, and relative positions accurately. The model employs a range of SysMLV2 capabilities, from spatial item definitions, complex attribute calculation (like wheel radius from dimensions), to the dynamic placement of lug bolts using trigonometric functions and loops for assertion-based positioning. Importantly, it lays out the vehicle's assembly, specifying how parts such as the wheels are oriented and positioned in relation to the vehicleâ€™s central reference frame, effectively translating engineering designs into a structured system model.
