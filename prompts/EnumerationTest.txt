Create a SysMLv2 model in a package named `EnumerationTest` which demonstrates various uses of enumerations and attributes. This model should include an enumeration extending a base attribute to define colors with specific values, illustrate different ways to instantiate these enumerations, and explore more complex scenarios such as optional enumeration keywords and restricting real-numbered attributes to certain values.
