**Explanation:**

* **Parts:** Battery, Device, Patient
* **Events:** BatteryDepletion, DeviceFailure, TherapyDelay
* **Connections:**
    * BatteryToDevice: Connects the battery to the device.
    * DeviceToFailure: Connects the device to the DeviceFailure event.
    * FailureToDelay: Connects the DeviceFailure event to the TherapyDelay event.
* **Relations:**
    * BatteryToDevice: Causes the BatteryDepletion event.
    * DeviceFailure: Causes the DeviceFailure event.
    * TherapyDelay: Results from the FailureToDelay event.
* **Causation Metadata:** Specifies the necessity and probability of each causation relationship.

**Note:**

* The model assumes a direct relationship between battery depletion and device failure.
* The probability of each causation relationship is provided as an example.
* The model does not include any specific details about the medical device or patient.
