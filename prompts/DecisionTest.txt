A SysMLV2 model named `DecisionTest` is designed to demonstrate decision making and the execution of actions based on specific conditions. It starts by defining an attribute `x` with an initial value. A decision-making structure is then introduced, where actions are executed depending on the value of `x`. This includes scenarios where `x` is exactly 1, greater than 1, or does not meet these conditions. Aside from decisions based on `x`, there is a decision block that executes actions based purely on boolean conditions. The model further specifies the sequence in which actions are executed, including conditional execution based on the value of `x`. This is intended to showcase how decision flows and action sequences are modeled in SysMLV2.
