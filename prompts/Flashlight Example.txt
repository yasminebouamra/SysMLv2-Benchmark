Design a SysML v2 model for a flashlight system that includes a user sending commands to turn the flashlight on or off, the flashlight responding by producing light, and a surface reflecting the light. The model should specify types for on-off commands and light, define ports for these types, create parts for the user, flashlight, and reflecting surface, and detail the interactions and flows between these parts to simulate illuminating a region.
