A model delineating a system's architecture comprising three distinct layers: an Application Layer for user interactions, a Service Layer hosting business logic, and a Data Layer for managing data persistence. It further articulates dependencies between these layers to illustrate data and control flow. Additionally, the model introduces attributes to showcase dependency relations amongst them, enhancing the understanding of data flow and transformations within the system.
