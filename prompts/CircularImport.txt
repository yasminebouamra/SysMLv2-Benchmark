Develop a SysMLv2 model depicting a structure where two packages (P1 and P2) import each other's contents, demonstrating a circular import scenario. Within this model, define parts in both packages and additional packages (Test1 and Test2) that use these parts. Illustrate the ability to reference these parts across the circular dependency boundary, ensuring that parts from each package are accessible despite the circular import, within a top-level package named `CircularImport`.
