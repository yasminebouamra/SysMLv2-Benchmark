```sysml
package InterfaceCompatibilityIssue {

    interface Engine {
        port clutch : ClutchPort;
    }

    interface Transmission {
        port drivePwr : DrivePwrPort;
    }

    part Vehicle {
        part engine : Engine;
        part transmission : Transmission;

        metadata CompatibilityIssue {
            message = "Compatibility issue between Engine and Transmission interfaces.";
            reason = "Port type mismatch between ClutchPort and DrivePwrPort.";
        }
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

* The model defines an `Engine` and `Transmission` interface, each with a single port.
* The `Vehicle` part connects an `Engine` and a `Transmission` instance.
* The `CompatibilityIssue` metadata is attached to the `Vehicle` part, providing a specific description of the interface compatibility issue.
* The `CompatibilityIssue` metadata specifies the message and reason for the issue, highlighting the mismatch between the `ClutchPort` and `DrivePwrPort` types.
