A model in SysML v2 showcasing the management of mass properties of vehicle components. It includes definitions for components, vehicles, and constraints to ensure the total mass of a vehicle equals the sum of its components' masses. Various constraint implementations and vehicle variants demonstrate different methods of applying and binding these constraints. Additionally, it features a unique constraint to compare mass limitations between two vehicle variants.
