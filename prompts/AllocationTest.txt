A SysMLv2 model is constructed to demonstrate the allocation of logical components to physical assemblies within a systems architecture framework. It introduces definitions for logical and physical components, instancing these components with specific elements highlighted. The model employs SysMLv2's allocation mechanisms, showcasing both a generic and a specific allocation definition aimed at linking logical components to physical ones. Additionally, it exemplifies allocations using both implicit and explicit syntaxes, as well as direct allocation between component parts, capturing the essence of system modeling's flexibility in expressing allocations.
