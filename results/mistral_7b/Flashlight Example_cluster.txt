 ```SysMLV2
   package FlashlightSystem {

      }

      part def ReflectingSurface {
         port def reflectedLight : LightIntensity;
      }

      connection DefinedInterface {
         connectorDef flashlightController {
            provided operation commandSend(command : Command) : Void;
            required operation getLightLevel(level : out LightIntensity) : Void;
         }
      }

      Flashlight.StateMachine << connectorDef flashlightController.provided;
      User << connectorDef flashlightController.required;
      ReflectingSurface << connectorDef flashlightController.required;
   }
   ```

In this SysML v2 model, we have defined a `FlashlightSystem` package that includes the following:

1. Attributes for Command types (on and off) and LightIntensity.
2. Part definitions for User, Flashlight, and ReflectingSurface with associated ports for commands and light intensity.
3. A state machine for the Flashlight part to control turning on/off based on user commands.
4. Definition of a `DefinedInterface` connection to specify the operations required (commandSend) and provided (getLightLevel) for the flashlightController connector.
5. Connections between the User, Flashlight, ReflectingSurface, and flashlightController using the defined interface.
