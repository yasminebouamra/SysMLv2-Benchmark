Create a SysMLv2 model that demonstrates the modular approach of system modeling by defining reusable elements such as parts, ports, connections, and interfaces. It should include a package named `ConjugationTest` containing a simple port definition `P` and its conjugate `~P`, a part named `B` with these ports, a connection type `A` linking a port of type `P` to its conjugate `~P`, and an interface `I` abstracting the interaction between these port types. Additionally, define a more complex part `B1` that encompasses a nested part with these ports, a connection of type `A`, and an interface of type `I`, demonstrating how parts can contain other parts with their connections and how interfaces can abstract interaction points on parts.
