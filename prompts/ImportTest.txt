The model is designed to showcase the structuring of elements into nested packages, demonstrating the utilization of import statements for referencing parts across packages, and illustrating part definition and specialization. It's structured into two main packages, with one demonstrating private imports and part definitions, and the other showcasing how parts can extend or specialize parts defined in another package. Additionally, the model attempts to illustrate namespace management and visibility through selective imports, highlighting the intricate nature of package arrangements and element referencing in SysMLv2.
