Design a SysMLv2 model for representing the structure and metadata of local cloud systems and services. This model should include different levels of system designs, from high-level system-of-systems descriptions to detailed individual system and service definitions, focusing on aspects like service interfaces, protocols, and system interactions. Further, enrich this model by defining metadata for semantic annotations, linking the system and service structures with their meanings and roles within the architecture, and ensuring a coherent semantic model that captures both the architecture and its intended semantics across the local cloud ecosystem.
