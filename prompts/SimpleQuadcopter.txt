A simple quadcopter model is described using SysMLv2, detailing its structural and conceptual components, such as motor shapes, struts, propeller motor assemblies, and a camera system. Each part is defined with specific geometric forms (cylinders, boxes, cones) and placed in relation to the quadcopter's coordinate framework using transformations (translations and rotations). The model demonstrates how parts can be combined, altered, or positioned to capture the detailed physical architecture of the quadcopter.
