The model involves creating a structured approach to defining a vehicle component within a system using SysML v2. It employs packages for organization, introduces a vehicle part definition, and illustrates the use of an alias to make the vehicle component more specific as a car. The model further demonstrates how to selectively import and reuse the aliased component within a different context for clarity and encapsulation.
