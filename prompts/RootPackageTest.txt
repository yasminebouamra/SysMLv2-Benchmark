A model comprises three packages, demonstrating encapsulation, reuse, and specialization principles within SysMLv2. The first package defines a part type, while the second package privately imports the first to declare a part instance of that type. The third package then specializes this part instance using the subsets mechanism, illustrating inheritance and characteristic tailoring amidst controlled visibility and import scopes.
