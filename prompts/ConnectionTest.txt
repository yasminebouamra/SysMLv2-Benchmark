A SysMLv2 package named `ConnectionTest` is designed to showcase system modeling through a structured representation involving parts, connections, and flows. It contains definitions for parts with nested structures and connections among them, an abstract connection definition capable of connecting multiple parts, and an abstract flow definition signifying potential interactions. Additionally, the model employs instances of abstract connections connecting specific parts and a message illustrating a flow between a part to itself, demonstrating modular design principles, component relationships, and internal processes within a system.
