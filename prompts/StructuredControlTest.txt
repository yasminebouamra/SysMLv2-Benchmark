Create a SysML v2 model that includes showcasing structured control flow techniques through the use of a package named `StructuredControlTest`. The model should feature a single action element that demonstrates initial variable definitions, conditional logic implementations with `if-else` statements, increments under certain conditions, various looping constructs (such as `while`, generic `loop` with an exit condition, and `for` loop iterating over a fixed set of integers), and sequential operations. The action manipulates an integer attribute through these structures to illustrate control flow elements common in systems modeling and behavior description.
