Design a SysMLv2 model to represent and manage system requirements for a vehicle mass management system, incorporating goal definitions, detailed requirement specifications with associated risks, and annotations for status, originator, and owner information. This should include a structure to define goals as requirements, a specific requirement to ensure the total mass of a vehicle does not exceed a defined limit, and a mechanism to associate these goals with other requirements and constraints such as payload mass limitations. Use metadata to enrich the requirements with additional semantic information, linking them back to the broader system goals and detailing risk assessments for each requirement.
