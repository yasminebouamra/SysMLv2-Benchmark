A SysMLv2 package showcasing a variety of part multiplicities, including exact numbers, ranges, and unbounded instances, with a unique feature of utilizing an integer attribute to define specific multiplicities. Additionally, it explores a recursive attribute structure, demonstrating the use of an attribute within its own definition to set multiplicity, illustrating both basic and advanced SysMLv2 modeling concepts.
