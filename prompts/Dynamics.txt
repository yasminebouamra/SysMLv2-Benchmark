A package named Dynamics is developed for modeling the behavior of a vehicle moving in a straight line, incorporating calculations for power, acceleration, velocity, and position. It also includes two action definitions that apply these calculations to simulate vehicle dynamics over time, accommodating inputs like wheel power, drag coefficient, rolling resistance coefficient, mass, initial speed, and position, to produce outputs such as final acceleration, speed, and position.
