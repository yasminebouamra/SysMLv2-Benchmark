Design a comprehensive SysMLv2 model that represents a complex system for a simple vehicle. This model should encompass various aspects, including parts definitions, port interactions, signal transmissions, and vehicle configurations. Additionally, it should handle analytical models for evaluating fuel economy and reliability, alongside verification systems to ensure the vehicle meets predefined specifications. The model should also support the exploration of different vehicle configurations through a superset that allows for variation points and selection constraints, catering to safety and security considerations. Finally, ensure the inclusion of viewpoints and views to facilitate visualization and understanding of the vehicle's design and operation, emphasizing behavior, safety features, and component interconnections.
