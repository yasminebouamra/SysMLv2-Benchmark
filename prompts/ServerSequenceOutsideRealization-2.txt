Design a publish-subscribe system model where producers publish messages which are then intermediated by a server to consumers subscribed to specific topics. The system should ensure FIFO processing of messages and enable clear communication through defined ports and interfaces for publication and subscription actions. Use the SysMLv2 language to capture the behaviors of producers, servers, and consumers, including their interactions, message transfers, and the explicit binding of actions to messages in a configuration package.
