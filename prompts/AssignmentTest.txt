Create a SysMLV2 model that represents a counter system within the `AssignmentTest` package. This model should include a `Counter` structure with an integer attribute for the count, methods to increase and decrease this count, and a state machine for managing counting operations. The state machine should include states for incrementing and decrementing the count, with actions to transition between these states based on triggers. Additionally, define a function to perform the increment operation and an action demonstrating how to increment the counter count both directly and through the defined function.
