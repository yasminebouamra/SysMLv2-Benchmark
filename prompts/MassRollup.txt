This is a SysMLv2 package designed for the calculation of mass within a system, accommodating both singular objects and complex assemblies. It introduces a base part definition for representing entities with mass, then extends this concept to cover simple objects with direct mass values and composite objects composed of multiple parts, whose total mass is the sum of their components' masses. Additionally, it features a specialized composite object that only calculates the total mass based on a minimum mass criterion for its components, enabling more nuanced mass calculations.
