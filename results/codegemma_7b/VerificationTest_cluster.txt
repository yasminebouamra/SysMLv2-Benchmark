## Verification Test Model

```sysmlv2
package VerificationTest

part def Component {
  int property;
}

requirement def VerifiedRequirement {
  doc "The component's integer property should be zero.";
  expression property == 0;
}

component instance componentInstance : Component;

verification case def VerificationTestCase {
  subject component : Component;
  objective {
    doc "Verify that the component's integer property is zero.";
    expression component.property == 0;
  }
}

verification plan def ComprehensiveVerificationPlan {
  subject component : Component;
  objective {
    doc "Verify that the component meets the VerifiedRequirement.";
  }
  verificationCase = VerificationTestCase;
}

verification context def VerificationContext {
  verificationPlan comprehensiveVerificationPlan;
  componentInstance.property = 0;
}

```

**Explanation:**

* The model includes a `Component` part with an integer `property`.
* A `VerifiedRequirement` is defined to specify the desired behavior.
* An instance of the `Component` is created.
* A `VerificationTestCase` is defined to test if the component's `property` is zero.
* A `ComprehensiveVerificationPlan` uses the `VerificationTestCase` to verify the requirement.
* A `VerificationContext` is defined to provide the necessary context for running the verification plan. It sets the component's `property` to zero and specifies the plan to be used.

This model provides a structured and traceable approach to conducting a verification test within a system. It ensures that the component meets the defined requirement and provides an organized way to track the verification process.
