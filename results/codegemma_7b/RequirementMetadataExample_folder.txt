**Explanation:**

* The model includes a goal called "VehicleMassManagementGoal" to define the overall objective.
* Two requirements are defined: "TotalVehicleMassRequirement" and "PayloadMassRequirement".
* Each requirement is linked to the goal using the "goal" attribute.
* The "TotalVehicleMassRequirement" has a risk assessment and associated metadata for status, originator, and owner.
* A constraint called "VehicleMassConstraint" ensures that the total vehicle mass does not exceed 2,500 kg.
* The two requirements are linked by an association called "VehicleMassRequirement-PayloadMassRequirement".
