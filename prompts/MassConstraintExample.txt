A package demonstrating the use of SysMLv2 for modeling parts of vehicles with specific focus on mass constraints. It illustrates several approaches to enforce constraints on mass, ranging from simple assertions to formal constraint definitions, across different vehicles and components like engines and transmissions. The constraints ensure that total vehicle mass calculations adhere to predefined rules or limits, showcasing modularity and reusability in system design with precise and correct unit measurements.
