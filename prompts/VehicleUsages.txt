A model showcasing the implementation and usage of vehicle components, including various wheel configurations with different lug bolt counts and specific torque applications, as well as detailed vehicle configurations that evolve from a basic setup to more specialized versions with defined part connections and dynamic interactions. This serves to exemplify the capabilities of SysMLv2 in modeling complex systems with emphasis on hierarchical structuring, parts specialization, and detailed interface connections.
