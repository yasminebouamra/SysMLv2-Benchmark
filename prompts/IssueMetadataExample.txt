Design a SysMLv2 model highlighting an interface compatibility issue between an engine and transmission system. The model should identify a compatibility problem using metadata to annotate an engine-to-transmission interface, outlining a specific mismatch between expected and actual port types. Define interfaces, ports, and parts to represent the mechanical connection in detail, ensuring the model explicates the inconsistency between ClutchPort and DrivePwrPort types and their impact on system functionality.
