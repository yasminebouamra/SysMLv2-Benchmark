Create a SysMLV2 model that simulates the behavior of a cart subject to an external force, illustrating the principles of state space representation. This model should include definitions for the cart, detailing its mass, input (force), output (velocity), state (velocity), and state derivative (acceleration). Additionally, include a pusher component that generates a constant force. The model should also specify the interactions between the cart and pusher, particularly how the force from the pusher is transmitted to the cart, impacting its velocity and demonstrating continuous state dynamics.
