A publish-subscribe system is implemented where producers publish messages on specific topics, a server handles these publication and subscription requests by matching topics, and consumers subscribe to topics to receive messages. The system, organized within a package, outlines the components and their interactions including producer behavior for publishing messages, server behavior for processing requests and delivering messages to appropriate subscribers, and consumer behavior for subscribing and receiving messages. The model also details interfaces and ports for communication between producers, server, and consumers, alongside the sequence of events for message publication, subscription, and delivery.
