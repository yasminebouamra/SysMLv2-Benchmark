The model in question is developed using SysMLv2, focusing on depicting occurrences, individual occurrences, snapshots, and timeslices to represent aspects of a system's structure and behavior over time. It introduces a framework within the `OccurrenceTest` package, including templates for generic occurrences and individual occurrences, both of which are detailed with attributes, references, items, parts, states, and periods. Moreover, it outlines how these occurrences and individual occurrences can be instantiated and interconnected, encompassing complex hierarchies and states (snapshots and timeslices) to demonstrate the system's dynamics and structural relationships at various points in its lifecycle.
