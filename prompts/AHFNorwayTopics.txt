A model outlines a system for monitoring product deliveries at a Norwegian chemical factory using the Arrowhead Framework. It demonstrates the interaction between several components, including service definitions, ports, cloud configurations, and state machines, to enable the exchange and monitoring of product information. The architecture features include a service for pulling product information using JSON protocol, asynchronous operations through HTTP and MQTT protocols for publishing/subscribing items, and remote procedure calls. The model includes three systems ('TellUConsumer', 'APISProducer', 'APISConsumer') interacting within a local cloud configuration to facilitate service discovery and exchange of product information through publish/subscribe operations and remote procedure calls with asynchronous acknowledgments.
