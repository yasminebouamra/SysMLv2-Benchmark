A SysMLV2 model of a simple publish-subscribe system involving three entities: a producer, a server, and a consumer. The model demonstrates the interaction between these entities to publish, route, and consume messages according to topics. It includes configurations for communication ports, behaviors for publishing and subscribing, as well as state management for message delivery based on topic matching. Connections between entities are made through port interfaces, and the process flow is detailed through message transfers and event mappings.
