Design a SysMLV2 model for conducting a verification test within a system. The model should include a component with an integer property, a defined requirement, and an instance of that component. It also needs a verification case that checks if the component's integer property equals zero, a comprehensive verification plan that utilizes this verification case, and a specific context for executing the verification plan. The goal is to validate that the component instance meets the defined requirement through a structured and traceable approach.
