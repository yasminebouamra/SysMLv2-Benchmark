Design a SysMLv2 framework for analyzing turbojet stages, focusing on thermodynamics principles and measurements. Include packages for thermodynamic functions with essential calculations like the ideal gas law, reversible adiabatic compression, and total enthalpy. Define a thermodynamic structure to model ideal and moving gas parcels, incorporating attributes and pressures for analysis. Finally, apply this framework to a low-pressure compressor analysis, demonstrating attribute calculation and binding for an inlet gas analysis.
