In the `RequirementDerivationExample`, the focus is on illustrating how requirements can be derived and then satisfied within a system composed of a main system and two subsystems. This model defines a high-level requirement that is broken down into more specific, derived requirements. These derived requirements are then satisfied by different parts of the system: the main system and its two subsystems, creating a clear lineage from high-level goals to specific implementations. A derivation connection formalizes the relationship between the high-level requirement and its derived, more specific requirements, showcasing the hierarchical decomposition of system goals. Additionally, the model includes a scenario where these requirements are satisfied by various system components, emphasizing the need for correct alignments and mappings in complex system architectures to ensure accurate requirement traceability and fulfillment.
