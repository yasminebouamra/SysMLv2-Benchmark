This SysML v2 model named 'VehicleDefinitions' defines the basic structure of a vehicle's mechanical components. It includes parts such as Vehicle, Transmission, AxleAssembly, Axles, Wheels, and Lugbolts, with an emphasis on mass and torque aspects. The model uses imported base for quantifiable attributes using international measurement standards. It specifies the interactions and connections between components using ports and an interface, focusing on the transmission of torque from axles to wheels which is crucial for understanding vehicle dynamics. The Transmission, Axle, and Lugbolt parts implement an interface to output torque as a force attribute.
