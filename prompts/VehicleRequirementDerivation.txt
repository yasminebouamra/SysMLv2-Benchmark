Create a SysMLv2 model that encapsulates the mass properties and requirements for a vehicle and its components, including the chassis and engine. Each component, including the overall vehicle, should have an attribute for its mass. Define a generic mass requirement that specifies a maximum mass limit and derive specific mass requirements for the vehicle, chassis, and engine based on this generic requirement. Establish a derivation connection to illustrate that the specific mass requirements for the chassis and engine are linked to the overall vehicle mass requirement.
