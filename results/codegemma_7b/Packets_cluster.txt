## SysMLV2 Model for Data Packet Structure

```
package DataPacketStructure {

  // Base template for packet headers
  class Header {
    attribute version : Integer;
    attribute sequenceNumber : Integer;
  }

  // Base template for data fields
  class DataField {
    attribute dataType : String;
    attribute data : String;
  }

  // Specific template for thermal data packets
  class ThermalDataPacket {
    include Header;
    attribute timestamp : Integer; // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    attribute temperature : Real;
    include DataField;
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The model includes three classes:
    * `Header`: Defines the common header fields for all data packets.
    * `DataField`: Defines a generic data field with type and data.
    * `ThermalDataPacket`: Extends the `Header` class and includes an additional field for temperature and extends the `DataField` class.
* The `ThermalDataPacket` class includes fields for version, sequence number, timestamp, temperature, and a generic data field.
* This structure provides a base for further customization and specialization for different data transmission scenarios.

**Note:**

* This model provides a basic structure and may require further expansion depending on specific needs.
* Additional classes and attributes can be added for additional data fields and functionalities.
