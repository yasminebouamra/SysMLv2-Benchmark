This model is centered around defining the mass properties of different vehicle parts, building up from a basic structure where each part is identified by a unique serial number, and extending to more complex scenarios involving a car that comprises of various car parts like engine and transmission. It has capabilities to specifically assign and override masses for individual parts, aiming for a detailed summation of total mass. Through inheritance and composition, it demonstrates how vehicles can be modeled down to the granularity of their component's mass, enabled by using standard units of measure for mass and mechanisms to aggregate these values.
