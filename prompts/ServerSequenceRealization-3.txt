Describe a SysML v2 model for a distributed publish-subscribe system with a server acting as an intermediary. The system needs to support message publishing by producers, message delivery handling by a server, and message consumption by consumers. It involves configuring ports and interfaces for interaction, defining behaviors for publishing, subscribing, and delivering, and establishing connection interfaces between producers, the server, and consumers. Additionally, specify the flow of messages from publishing, through server processing, to delivery to consumers, ensuring that producers and consumers are decoupled in their operation.
