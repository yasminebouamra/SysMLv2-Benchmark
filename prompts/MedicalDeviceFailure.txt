Create a SysMLV2 model that encapsulates the failure scenarios of a medical device and its impacts. The model should specifically explore how battery issues, such as depletion or inability to charge, cause the device to fail, and how this failure directly affects patient care by delaying therapy. Incorporate elements like parts, references, events, and connections to clearly depict the cause-and-effect relationships between the battery's state, device failure, and the consequent delay in therapy.
