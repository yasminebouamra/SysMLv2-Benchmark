## SysMLv2 Model for Vehicle Configuration Tracking

```sysmlv2
package VehicleConfiguration {

    type Timestamp {
        attribute value : integer;
    }

    type Vehicle {
        attribute mass : double;
        attribute configuration : Configuration;
        attribute timestamp : Timestamp;
    }

    type Configuration {
        type Wheel {
            attribute diameter : double;
            attribute position : double;
        }

        type Axle {
            attribute wheel1 : Wheel;
            attribute wheel2 : Wheel;
        }

        attribute axles : Axle[];
    }

    type VehicleHistory {
        attribute vehicle : Vehicle;
        attribute timestamp : Timestamp;
    }

    association VehicleHistory_Vehicle {
        source : VehicleHistory;
        target : Vehicle;
        multiplicity : 1..*
    }

    association Vehicle_Configuration {
        source : Vehicle;
        target : Configuration;
        multiplicity : 1..*
    }

    association VehicleHistory_Timestamp {
        source : VehicleHistory;
        target : Timestamp;
        multiplicity : 1..*
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Timestamp:** Defines a type to represent timestamps.
* **Vehicle:** Defines a type to represent individual vehicles with attributes like mass, configuration, and timestamp.
* **Configuration:** Defines a type to represent the configuration of a vehicle, including wheels and axles.
* **VehicleHistory:** Defines a type to store snapshots of vehicles at different timestamps.
* **VehicleHistory_Vehicle:** Links VehicleHistory instances to Vehicle instances.
* **Vehicle_Configuration:** Links Vehicle instances to Configuration instances.
* **VehicleHistory_Timestamp:** Links VehicleHistory instances to Timestamp instances.

**Usage:**

* Create instances of the Vehicle type with unique timestamps.
* Define configurations for each vehicle.
* Add VehicleHistory instances to track vehicle configurations at specific timestamps.
* Use queries to retrieve vehicle configurations at desired timestamps.

**Note:**

* This model focuses on the structure of the data and does not include any specific constraints or behaviors.
* Additional elements can be added to the model to represent specific requirements.
