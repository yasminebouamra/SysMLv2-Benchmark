A SysMLv2 model demonstrates namespace management and element visibility across packages using import statements. It features a primary package named `QualifiedNameImportTest` housing two subpackages `P1` and `P2`. `P1` includes a part definition named `A`. Inside `P2`, there is a nested package `P2a` with a public import statement that imports everything from `P1`. Consequently, it allows a part named `x` within `P2` to be defined as type `A` from `P1`, showcasing the model's modular structure and the reuse of the part definition `A` across packages through qualified naming and import directives.
