This SysML v2 model named `VehicleDefinitions` encapsulates a simplistic structure of a vehicle's mechanical components. It involves defining parts such as the Vehicle itself, Transmission, Axle Assembly, Axles, Wheels, and Lugbolts with emphasis on aspects like mass and torque. Through imports, it establishes a base for quantifiable attributes using international measurement standards. It specifies the interactions and connections between components using ports and an interface, focusing particularly on the transmission of torque from axles to wheels, essential for understanding vehicle dynamics.
