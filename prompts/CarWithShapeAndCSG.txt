Create a simplified SysMLV2 model of a car with its dimensions represented by a 3D cuboid and incorporating a basic 2-cylinder engine model using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). The car model should include a coordinate frame for positioning the engine within the car based on specific dimensions. The engine component itself should be depicted as a rectangular block with cylindrical holes to represent the cylinders, positioned within the engine block through translation transformations based on the engine's coordinate frame. The difference in volumes between the engine block and the cylinders illustrates the engine's internal structure.
