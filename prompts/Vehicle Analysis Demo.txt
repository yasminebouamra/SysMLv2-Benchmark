Create a SysMLv2 model for analyzing the fuel economy of vehicles, which entails defining custom units like miles per gallon, modeling the vehicle's physical components (fuel tank, wheels, etc.), specifying fuel economy requirements for different driving conditions, and implementing calculations for dynamics such as acceleration and velocity. Include packages for vehicle quantities, vehicle models, fuel economy requirements, dynamics modeling, and fuel economy analysis, and apply the model to analyze specific scenarios to ensure compliance with fuel economy standards.
