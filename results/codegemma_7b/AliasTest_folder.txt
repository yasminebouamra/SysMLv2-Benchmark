```
package AliasTest {

	part def A {
		port p1 : InFlow;
		port p2 : OutFlow;
	}

	part a : A;

	part def B {
		port p1 : InFlow;
		port p2 : OutFlow;
	}

	part b : B;

	flow a.p1 to b.p2;

	alias bport1 for b.p1;
	alias bport2 for b.p2;

	flow a.p1 to bport1;
	flow a.p2 to bport2;

}
```

**Explanation:**

* The model includes two parts, `A` and `B`.
* Each part has two ports, `p1` and `p2`.
* The `flow` keyword is used to establish connections between ports.
* The `alias` keyword is used to create alternative references to ports.
* The aliases `bport1` and `bport2` are created for `b.p1` and `b.p2`, respectively.
* The connections are updated to use the aliases instead of the original port references.

**Benefits of Using Aliases:**

* Increased readability and code maintainability.
* Improved flexibility for port connections.
* Enhanced modularity and code reuse.

**Note:**

* Aliases are only valid within the same package.
* Aliases cannot be used to refer to parts or other elements outside of the package.
