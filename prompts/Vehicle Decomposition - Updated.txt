Develop a SysMLv2 model to represent the hierarchical structure and customizable components of a vehicle. This model should demonstrate the decomposition of a vehicle into its fundamental parts, such as the chassis assembly, wheels, and engine, along with specific configurations that result in different vehicle models. The model must include examples of part definitions, instances, and specialized variations that introduce constraints and redefine components, such as the number of cylinders in the engine or the type of roll bar in the chassis assembly.
