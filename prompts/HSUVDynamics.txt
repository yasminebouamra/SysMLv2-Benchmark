Create a SysMLV2 model for simulating the straight-line dynamics of a high-speed unmanned vehicle. This model should include attributes such as horsepower, weight, acceleration, velocity, distance, and time to define the vehicle's physical properties and dynamics. It will utilize a series of constraint definitions that represent core physical equations: a power equation to model the relationship between engine power, drag, vehicle weight, and velocity; a position equation for calculating the vehicle's change in position over time; a velocity equation to determine changes in velocity given the acceleration; and an acceleration equation connecting the vehicle's acceleration to its weight and engine power. These constraints are integrated within a composite constraint to simulate the vehicle's straight-line movement, accounting for how power impacts acceleration, and in turn, how acceleration affects velocity and position.
