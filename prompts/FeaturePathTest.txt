Create a SysMLV2 model named `Q` that demonstrates the usage of part definitions, instances, enumerations, relationships, and recursive structures. It should define part types `F`, `A`, `B`, and `C`, enumerating complex relationships like cyclic dependencies, connections, and bindings within `C`. The model also involves subsetting and flow relationships, an enumeration type `E` with elements `e1` and `e2`, and an attribute in a part that binds to one of the enumeration's elements. Include a unique construction showcasing a recursive relationship through part `g`.
