The model involves a trade study comparison between two engine parts, assessing which engine optimally meets certain predefined objectives. It encompasses the definition of engine parts, instantiation of two engines for analysis, and the setup of a trade study. The study aims to maximize an objective, detailed through an evaluation function that assesses each engine's performance against the set criteria, ultimately recommending the more suitable engine based on these criteria.
