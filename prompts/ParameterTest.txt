Create a model in SysMLV2 that encapsulates a package named `ParameterTest` containing attribute and calculation definitions. Within this package, define an attribute `A` that includes a string attribute `x` and a recursive reference to itself as attribute `y`. Also, include a calculation `F` that takes an instance of `A` and an integer as inputs and returns an integer. The model should demonstrate instantiation of `A` with various initializations and the application of `F` through different calling conventions, illustrating the use of both positional and named parameters in function calls.
