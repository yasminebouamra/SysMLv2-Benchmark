A detailed SysMLV2 model encompassing a sophisticated setup of part hierarchies, behaviors, and interfaces within a named container `PartTest`. It defines intricacies like parts with specific cardinality, abstract templates for part definitions offering a framework for subsets and behavior encapsulation, complex port configurations for interaction, and recursive part relationships to demonstrate a robust system modeling example. The structure aims to highlight advanced system engineering concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, reusability, and hierarchical organization.
