A model in SysMLv2 for an Electric Vehicle (EV) system that includes definitions for the vehicle's main components such as the vehicle itself, its battery, motor, and tires. The model also outlines custom units, requirements, and analyses for attributes like range, efficiency, and maximum speed. It incorporates state space dynamics for each component to simulate behavior over time and includes conditions for small and large electric vehicles with specific performance targets.
