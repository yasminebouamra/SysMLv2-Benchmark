Create a SysMLv2 model representing the structure and components of a Wheel Hub Assembly similar to the example in the SysML 1.6 spec. This model should include the entire assembly with detailed parts like the Wheel Assembly, Tire, Tire Bead, and others, defining both physical aspects and actions (e.g., mounting tires, transmitting pressure). Include quantities like pressure as force per unit area, connections between components such as the Pressure Seat and Band Mount, and assembly composition detailing how parts like the Tire, Wheel, and Hub come together with specific attributes and multiplicity.
